## Live-version

[Weather-Dashboard App](https://weather-dashboard-87yg.onrender.com/)

## About

This is a weather dashboard app. The app uses [weatherapi](https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/) to fetch weather forecast and displays weather information of a location that user can search.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/durlavkalita/weather-dashboard

# Go into the repository
$ cd weather-dashboard

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Generate application key
$ npm run start

```

The application should start on [localhost:4200](http://127.0.0.1:4200/)

## Architecture

The app uses some of the most well known angular functionalities. For weather search based on location and forecast display a `weather` component was created using `ng generate component weather`. Similarly to handle api calls to [weatherapi](https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/) a service was created using `ng generate service weather`. For icons [angular material](https://material.angular.io/) and for styling [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) has been used. The site is fully responsive and displays a weather forecast of Guwahati city on 2024-06-22 21:21 by default.
